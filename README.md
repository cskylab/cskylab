## Private Cloud Model

[cSkyLab](https://www.cskylab.com/) is a private cloud model that gives you the choice to deploy your applications and services in any combination of private, public or hybrid cloud.

It is designed to bootstrap your own secure private cloud with a modern DevOps environment, that allows you to develop and service cloud-native applications in Kubernetes environments.

It brings "out of the box" many popular technologies up and running, ready to be used in your own projects such as:

- [OpnSense](https://opnsense.org) Firewall, networking infrastructure and security
- [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/) Mirrored virtual machine infrastructure
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) Separated k8s clusters for modeling (staging) and production
- Local Thin-LVM and [MinIO](https://min.io) S3 compatible storage
- [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) Bare Metal LoadBalancing
- [Cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) Certificate management
- [NGINX Ingress](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) Reverse proxy
- [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) Private registry
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) Identity management
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) Private DevOps platform
- [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) Colaboration and file sharing
- [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) Meetings and conference
- K8s installation models for databases (MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, MSSQL...) and custom applications

And many more to come ...
