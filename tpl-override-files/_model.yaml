#
#   Steps to prepare the overrides:
#
#     - Go to `tpl-override-files` directory in your installation, and create 
#       the `service_name.yaml` overrides file by copying contents 
#       from `_model.yaml` file. 
#       
#       It is highly recommended to name the `service_name.yaml` overrides file, 
#       according to the service and destination directory names
#       (Ex. `k8s-mod-n1.yaml`, `k8s-mod-metallb.yaml`...).
#
#     - Go to the directory of the template you're working with, and open 
#       the values file `_values-tpl`
#
#     - Copy the `values to override` section from the file `_values-tpl` into 
#       the same section in your `service_name.yaml` overrides file.
#
#     - Override the desired values
#
#     - Modify the code commented command `cskygen create` with the appropriate flags:
#       - Destination directory `-d`
#       - Template directory `-t`
#       - Overrides file `-f` (.yaml extension required on filename but not in flag)
#
#     - Save the file

# 
#   Command:
#
#   cskygen create -t ../tpl/template_name -d ../cs-mod/service_name -f service_name
#

#
# Values to override
